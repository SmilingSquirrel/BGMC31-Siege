# BGMC31-Siege Shooting Gallery

Made by SmilingSquirrel in 7 days for BGMC 31.

Built in <a href="https://upbge.org">UPBGE v0.2.4</a> (Required to play), Siege Shooting Gallery is a game base. Due to time constraints, the game has no true levels, just a small "Learn to Play" world that gives the player a chance to use the different weapons. The player has three guns, and a variety of targets to shoot, and explode.
